It enables peer-to-peer exchange of value in the digital realm through the use of a decentralized protocol, cryptography, and a mechanism to achieve global consensus on the state of a periodically updated public transaction ledger called a &#039;blockchain.&#039;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Practically speaking, Bitcoin is a form of digital money that (1) exists independently of any government, state, or financial institution, (2) can be transferred globally without the need for a centralized intermediary, and (3) has a known monetary policy that arguably cannot be altered.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At a deeper level, Bitcoin can be described as a political, philosophical, and economic system. This is thanks to the combination of the technical features it integrates, the wide array of participants and stakeholders it involves, and the process for making changes to the protocol.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bitcoin can refer to the Bitcoin software protocol as well as to the monetary unit, which goes by the ticker symbol BTC.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Launched anonymously in January 2009 to a niche group of technologists, Bitcoin is now a globally traded financial asset with daily settled volume measured in the tens of billions of dollars. Although its regulatory status varies by region and continues to evolve, Bitcoin is most commonly regulated as either a currency or a commodity, and is legal to use (with varying levels of restrictions) in all major economies. In June 2021, El Salvador became the first country to mandate Bitcoin as legal tender.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is Bitcoin used for?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;At its most basic level, Bitcoin is useful for transacting value outside of the traditional financial system. People use Bitcoin to, for example, make international payments that are settled faster, more securely, and at lower transactional fees than through legacy settlement methods such as the SWIFT or ACH networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the early years, when network adoption was sparse, Bitcoin could be used to settle even small-value transactions, and do so competitively with payment networks like Visa and Mastercard (which, in fact, &lt;i&gt;settle&lt;/i&gt; transactions long after point of sale). However, as Bitcoin became more widely used, scaling issues made it less competitive as a medium of exchange for small-value items. In short, it became prohibitively expensive to settle small-value transactions due to limited throughput on the ledger and the lack of availability of second-layer solutions. This supported the narrative that Bitcoin&#039;s primary value is less as a payment network and more as an alternative to gold, or &#039;digital gold.&#039; Here, the argument is that Bitcoin derives value from a combination of the technological breakthroughs it integrates, its capped supply with &#039;built-into-the-code&#039; monetary policy, and its powerful network effects. In this regard, the investment thesis is that Bitcoin could replace gold and potentially become a form of &#039;pristine collateral&#039; for the global economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another popular narrative is that Bitcoin supports economic freedom. It is said to do this by providing, on an opt-in basis, an alternative form of money that integrates strong protection against (1) monetary confiscation, (2) censorship, and (3) devaluation through uncapped inflation. Note that this narrative is not mutually exclusive from the &#039;digital gold&#039; narrative.&lt;/p&gt;', 0, '2023-01-21 16:24:22'),

It&#039;s also known as information technology security or electronic information security. The term applies in a variety of contexts, from business to mobile computing, and can be divided into a few common categories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&middot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Network security&lt;/strong&gt; is the practice of securing a computer network from intruders, whether targeted attackers or opportunistic malware.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&middot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Application security&lt;/strong&gt; focuses on keeping software and devices free of threats. A compromised application could provide access to the data its designed to protect. Successful security begins in the design stage, well before a program or device is deployed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&middot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Information security&lt;/strong&gt; protects the integrity and privacy of data, both in storage and in transit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&middot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Operational security&lt;/strong&gt; includes the processes and decisions for handling and protecting data assets. The permissions users have when accessing a network and the procedures that determine how and where data may be stored or shared all fall under this umbrella.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&middot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Disaster recovery and business continuity&lt;/strong&gt; define how an organization responds to a cyber-security incident or any other event that causes the loss of operations or data. Disaster recovery policies dictate how the organization restores its operations and information to return to the same operating capacity as before the event. Business continuity is the plan the organization falls back on while trying to operate without certain resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&middot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;End-user education&lt;/strong&gt; addresses the most unpredictable cyber-security factor: people. Anyone can accidentally introduce a virus to an otherwise secure system by failing to follow good security practices. Teaching users to delete suspicious email attachments, not plug in unidentified USB drives, and various other important lessons is vital for the security of any organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The scale of the cyber threat&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The global cyber threat continues to evolve at a rapid pace, with a rising number of data breaches each year. A report by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.riskbasedsecurity.com/2019/11/12/number-of-records-exposed-up-112/&quot;&gt;RiskBased Security&lt;/a&gt; revealed that a shocking 7.9 billion records have been exposed by data breaches in the first nine months of 2019 alone. This figure is more than double (112%) the number of records exposed in the same period in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medical services, retailers and public entities experienced the most breaches, with malicious criminals responsible for most incidents. Some of these sectors are more appealing to cybercriminals because they collect financial and medical data, but all businesses that use networks can be targeted for customer data, corporate espionage, or customer attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the scale of the cyber threat set to continue to rise, global spending on cybersecurity solutions is naturally increasing. Gartner predicts cybersecurity spending will reach $188.3 billion in 2023 and surpass $260 billion globally by 2026. Governments across the globe have responded to the rising cyber threat with guidance to help organizations implement effective cyber-security practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the U.S., the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has created a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework/framework&quot;&gt;cyber-security framework&lt;/a&gt;. To combat the proliferation of malicious code and aid in early detection, the framework recommends continuous, real-time monitoring of all electronic resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The importance of system monitoring is echoed in the &ldquo;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/10-steps-to-cyber-security/introduction-to-cyber-security/executive-summary&quot;&gt;10 steps to cyber security&lt;/a&gt;&rdquo;, guidance provided by the U.K. government&rsquo;s National Cyber Security Centre. In Australia, The&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cyber.gov.au/&quot;&gt;Australian Cyber Security Centre&lt;/a&gt;(ACSC) regularly publishes guidance on how organizations can counter the latest cyber-security threats.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;', 1, '2023-01-28 14:31:06'),
(5, 1, 4, 'What is artificial intelligence?', '1679074951_artificial-intelligence-AI.jpg', '&lt;h1&gt;What is artificial intelligence?&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;While a number of definitions of artificial intelligence (AI) have surfaced over the last few decades, John McCarthy offers the following definition in this 2004&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/whatisai.pdf&quot;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;(PDF, 106 KB) (link resides outside IBM), &quot; It is the science and engineering of making intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs. It is related to the similar task of using computers to understand human intelligence, but AI does not have to confine itself to methods that are biologically observable.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, decades before this definition, the birth of the artificial intelligence conversation was denoted by Alan Turing&#039;s seminal work, &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.csee.umbc.edu/courses/471/papers/turing.pdf&quot;&gt;Computing Machinery and Intelligence&lt;/a&gt;&quot; (PDF, 89.8 KB) (link resides outside of IBM), which was published in 1950. In this paper, Turing, often referred to as the &quot;father of computer science&quot;, asks the following question, &quot;Can machines think?&quot;&amp;nbsp; From there, he offers a test, now famously known as the &quot;Turing Test&quot;, where a human interrogator would try to distinguish between a computer and human text response. While this test has undergone much scrutiny since its publish, it remains an important part of the history of AI as well as an ongoing concept within philosophy as it utilizes ideas around linguistics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig then proceeded to publish,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/&quot;&gt;Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;(link resides outside IBM), becoming one of the leading textbooks in the study of AI. In it, they delve into four potential goals or definitions of AI, which differentiates computer systems on the basis of rationality and thinking vs. acting:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Human approach:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Systems that think like humans&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Systems that act like humans&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ideal approach:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Systems that think rationally&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Systems that act rationally&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alan Turing&rsquo;s definition would have fallen under the category of &ldquo;systems that act like humans.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At its simplest form, artificial intelligence is a field, which combines computer science and robust datasets, to enable problem-solving. It also encompasses sub-fields of machine learning and deep learning, which are frequently mentioned in conjunction with artificial intelligence. These disciplines are comprised of AI algorithms which seek to create expert systems which make predictions or classifications based on input data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, a lot of hype still surrounds AI development, which is expected of any new emerging technology in the market. As noted in&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/3887767&quot;&gt;Gartner&rsquo;s hype cycle&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;(link resides outside IBM), product innovations like, self-driving cars and personal assistants, follow &ldquo;a typical progression of innovation, from overenthusiasm through a period of disillusionment to an eventual understanding of the innovation&rsquo;s relevance and role in a market or domain.&rdquo; As Lex Fridman notes&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5xeyoRL95U&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;(01:08:05) (link resides outside IBM) in his MIT lecture in 2019, we are at the peak of inflated expectations, approaching the trough of disillusionment. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;', 1, '2023-01-28 14:34:17'),

Pop culture has always been fascinated with robots &mdash; examples include R2-D2, the Terminator and WALL-E. These over-exaggerated, humanoid concepts of robots usually seem like a caricature of the real thing. But are they more forward thinking than we realize? Robots are gaining intellectual and mechanical capabilities that don&rsquo;t put the possibility of a R2-D2-like machine out of reach in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;WHAT IS A ROBOT?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A robot is a programmable machine that can complete a task, while the term robotics describes the field of study focused on developing robots and automation. Each robot has a different level of autonomy. These levels range from human-controlled bots that carry out tasks to fully-autonomous bots that perform tasks without any external influences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As technology progresses, so too does the scope of what is considered robotics. In 2005, 90 percent of all robots could be found &lt;a href=&quot;https://builtin.com/robotics/automotive-cars-manufacturing-assembly&quot;&gt;assembling cars in automotive factories&lt;/a&gt;. These robots consist mainly of mechanical arms tasked with welding or screwing on certain parts of a car.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, we&rsquo;re seeing an evolved and expanded definition of robotics that includes the development, creation and use of bots that accomplish tasks like &lt;a href=&quot;https://builtin.com/robotics/underwater-robots-explore-antarctic-ice-shelf&quot;&gt;exploring the planet&rsquo;s harshest conditions&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://builtin.com/robotics/police-robot-law-enforcement&quot;&gt;assisting law enforcement&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href=&quot;https://builtin.com/robotics/surgical-medical-healthcare-robotics-companies&quot;&gt;streamlining surgical procedures&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://builtin.com/robotics/rescue-robots&quot;&gt;undertaking rescue missions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Robotics Defined&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the overall world of robotics is expanding, a robot has some consistent characteristics:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Robots consist of some sort of mechanical construction. The mechanical aspect of a robot helps it complete tasks in the environment for which it&rsquo;s designed. For example, the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/mission/rover/wheels/&quot;&gt;Mars 2020 Rover&rsquo;s wheels&lt;/a&gt; are individually motorized and made of titanium tubing that help it firmly grip the harsh terrain of the red planet.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Robots need electrical components that control and power the machinery. Essentially, an electric current &mdash; a battery, for example &mdash; is needed to power a large majority of robots.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Robots contain at least some level of computer programming. Without a set of code telling it what to do, a robot would just be another piece of simple machinery. Inserting a program into a robot gives it the ability to know when and how to carry out a task.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;We&rsquo;re bound to see the promise of the robotics industry sooner, rather than later, as&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://builtin.com/artificial-intelligence&quot;&gt;artificial intelligence&lt;/a&gt; and&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://builtin.com/software-engineering-perspectives&quot;&gt;software&lt;/a&gt; also continue to progress.

(7, 1, 6, 'Natural language processing', '1679072253_NLP-image.jpg', '&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Natural language processing (NLP) refers to the branch of computer science&mdash;and more specifically, the branch of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ibm.com/in-en/topics/artificial-intelligence&quot;&gt;artificial intelligence or AI&lt;/a&gt;&mdash;concerned with giving computers the ability to understand text and spoken words in much the same way human beings can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;NLP combines computational linguistics&mdash;rule-based modeling of human language&mdash;with statistical, machine learning, and deep learning models. Together, these technologies enable computers to process human language in the form of text or voice data and to &lsquo;understand&rsquo; its full meaning, complete with the speaker or writer&rsquo;s intent and sentiment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;NLP drives computer programs that translate text from one language to another, respond to spoken commands, and summarize large volumes of text rapidly&mdash;even in real time. There&rsquo;s a good chance you&rsquo;ve interacted with NLP in the form of voice-operated GPS systems, digital assistants, speech-to-text dictation software, customer service chatbots, and other consumer conveniences. But NLP also plays a growing role in enterprise solutions that help streamline business operations, increase employee productivity, and simplify mission-critical business processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NLP tasks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Human language is filled with ambiguities that make it incredibly difficult to write software that accurately determines the intended meaning of text or voice data. Homonyms, homophones, sarcasm, idioms, metaphors, grammar and usage exceptions, variations in sentence structure&mdash;these just a few of the irregularities of human language that take humans years to learn, but that programmers must teach natural language-driven applications to recognize and understand accurately from the start, if those applications are going to be useful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Several NLP tasks break down human text and voice data in ways that help the computer make sense of what it&#039;s ingesting. Some of these tasks include the following:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speech recognition&lt;/strong&gt;, also called speech-to-text, is the task of reliably converting voice data into text data. Speech recognition is required for any application that follows voice commands or answers spoken questions. What makes speech recognition especially challenging is the way people talk&mdash;quickly, slurring words together, with varying emphasis and intonation, in different accents, and often using incorrect grammar.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part of speech tagging&lt;/strong&gt;, also called grammatical tagging, is the process of determining the part of speech of a particular word or piece of text based on its use and context. Part of speech identifies &lsquo;make&rsquo; as a verb in &lsquo;I can make a paper plane,&rsquo; and as a noun in &lsquo;What make of car do you own?&rsquo;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Word sense disambiguation&lt;/strong&gt; is the selection of the meaning of a word with multiple meanings&amp;nbsp; through a process of semantic analysis that determine the word that makes the most sense in the given context. For example, word sense disambiguation helps distinguish the meaning of the verb&amp;nbsp;&#039;make&#039; in &lsquo;make the grade&rsquo; (achieve) vs. &lsquo;make a bet&rsquo; (place).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Named entity recognition,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;or NEM, identifies words or phrases as useful entities. NEM identifies &lsquo;Kentucky&rsquo; as a location or &lsquo;Fred&rsquo; as a man&#039;s name.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Co-reference resolution&lt;/strong&gt; is the task of identifying if and when two words refer to the same entity. The most common example is determining the person or object to which a certain pronoun refers (e.g., &lsquo;she&rsquo; = &lsquo;Mary&rsquo;), &amp;nbsp;but it can also involve identifying a metaphor or an idiom in the text &amp;nbsp;(e.g., an instance in which &#039;bear&#039; isn&#039;t an animal but a large hairy person).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sentiment analysis&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;attempts to extract subjective qualities&mdash;attitudes, emotions, sarcasm, confusion, suspicion&mdash;from text.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Natural language generation&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;is sometimes described as the opposite of speech recognition or speech-to-text; it&#039;s the task of putting structured information into human language.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;', 1, '2023-02-20 15:24:03'),

Enter the data scientist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Where did they come from?&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many data scientists began their careers as statisticians or data analysts. But as big data (and big data storage and processing technologies such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sas.com/en_us/insights/big-data/hadoop.html&quot;&gt;Hadoop&lt;/a&gt;) began to grow and evolve, those roles evolved as well. Data is no longer just an afterthought for IT to handle. It&rsquo;s key information that requires analysis, creative curiosity and a knack for translating high-tech ideas into new ways to turn a profit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The data scientist role also has academic origins. A few years ago, universities began to recognize that employers wanted people who were programmers and team players. Professors tweaked their classes to accommodate this &ndash; and some programs, such as the Institute for Advanced Analytics at North Carolina State University, prepared to churn out the next generation of data scientists. There are now more than 60 similar programs in universities around the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What&rsquo;s in a data scientist&rsquo;s toolbox?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;These terms and technologies are commonly used by data scientists:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sas.com/en_us/insights/big-data/data-visualization.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data visualization&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; the presentation of data in a pictorial or graphical format so it can be easily analyzed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sas.com/en_us/insights/analytics/machine-learning.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Machine learning&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; a branch of artificial &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sas.com/en_us/insights/analytics/what-is-artificial-intelligence.html&quot;&gt;intelligence&lt;/a&gt; based on mathematical algorithms and automation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sas.com/en_us/insights/analytics/deep-learning.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deep learning&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: an area of machine learning research that uses data to model complex abstractions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pattern recognition&lt;/strong&gt;: technology that recognizes patterns in data (often used interchangeably with machine learning).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sas.com/en_us/software/data-preparation.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data preparation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: the process of converting raw data into another format so it can be more easily consumed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sas.com/en_us/software/visual-text-analytics.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Text analytics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: the process of examining unstructured data to glean key business insights.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;', 1, '2023-02-20 15:31:50'),
(10, 1, 7, 'Supervised Learning', '1679076341_maxresdefault.jpg', '&lt;h2&gt;What is supervised learning?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Supervised learning, also known as supervised machine learning, is a subcategory of&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ibm.com/in-en/topics/machine-learning&quot;&gt;machine learning&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ibm.com/in-en/topics/artificial-intelligence&quot;&gt;artificial intelligence&lt;/a&gt;. It is defined by its use of labeled datasets to train algorithms that to classify data or predict outcomes accurately. As input data is fed into the model, it adjusts its weights until the model has been fitted appropriately, which occurs as part of the cross validation process. Supervised learning helps organizations solve for a variety of real-world problems at scale, such as classifying spam in a separate folder from your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How supervised learning works&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Supervised learning uses a training set to teach models to yield the desired output. This training dataset includes inputs and correct outputs, which allow the model to learn over time. The algorithm measures its accuracy through the loss function, adjusting until the error has been sufficiently minimized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Supervised learning can be separated into two types of problems when data mining&mdash;classification and regression:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Classification&amp;nbsp;uses an algorithm to accurately assign test data into specific categories. It recognizes specific entities within the dataset and attempts to draw some conclusions on how those entities should be labeled or defined. Common classification algorithms are linear classifiers, support vector machines (SVM), decision trees, k-nearest neighbor, and random forest, which are described in more detail below.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Regression&amp;nbsp;is used to understand the relationship between dependent and independent variables. It is commonly used to make projections, such as for sales revenue for a given business.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ibm.com/in-en/analytics/learn/linear-regression&quot;&gt;Linear regression&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ibm.com/in-en/analytics/learn/logistic-regression&quot;&gt;logistical regression&lt;/a&gt;, and polynomial regression are popular regression algorithms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Supervised learning algorithms&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Various algorithms and computation techniques are used in supervised machine learning processes. Below are brief explanations of some of the most commonly used learning methods, typically calculated through use of programs like R or Python:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neural networks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Primarily leveraged for deep learning algorithms,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ibm.com/in-en/topics/neural-networks&quot;&gt;neural networks&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;process training data by mimicking the interconnectivity of the human brain through layers of nodes. Each node is made up of inputs, weights, a bias (or threshold), and an output. If that output value exceeds a given threshold, it &ldquo;fires&rdquo; or activates the node, passing data to the next layer in the network. Neural networks learn this mapping function through supervised learning, adjusting based on the loss function through the process of gradient descent. When the cost function is at or near zero, we can be confident in the model&rsquo;s accuracy to yield the correct answer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Naive Bayes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Naive Bayes is classification approach that adopts the principle of class conditional independence from the Bayes Theorem. This means that the presence of one feature does not impact the presence of another in the probability of a given outcome, and each predictor has an equal effect on that result. There are three types of Na&iuml;ve Bayes classifiers: Multinomial Na&iuml;ve Bayes, Bernoulli Na&iuml;ve Bayes, and Gaussian Na&iuml;ve Bayes. This technique is primarily used in text classification, spam identification, and recommendation systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Linear regression&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Linear regression is used to identify the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables and is typically leveraged to make predictions about future outcomes. When there is only one independent variable and one dependent variable, it is known as simple linear regression. As the number of independent variables increases, it is referred to as multiple linear regression. For each type of linear regression, it seeks to plot a line of best fit, which is calculated through the method of least squares. However, unlike other regression models, this line is straight when plotted on a graph.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Logistic regression&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While linear regression is leveraged when dependent variables are continuous, logistical regression is selected when the dependent variable is categorical, meaning they have binary outputs, such as &quot;true&quot; and &quot;false&quot; or &quot;yes&quot; and &quot;no.&quot; While both regression models seek to understand relationships between data inputs, logistic regression is mainly used to solve binary classification problems, such as spam identification.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Support vector machine (SVM)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A support vector machine is a popular supervised learning model developed by Vladimir Vapnik, used for both data classification and regression. That said, it is typically leveraged for classification problems, constructing a hyperplane where the distance between two classes of data points is at its maximum. This hyperplane is known as the decision boundary, separating the classes of data points (e.g., oranges vs. apples) on either side of the plane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;K-nearest neighbor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;K-nearest neighbor, also known as the KNN algorithm, is a non-parametric algorithm that classifies data points based on their proximity and association to other available data. This algorithm assumes that similar data points can be found near each other. As a result, it seeks to calculate the distance between data points, usually through Euclidean distance, and then it assigns a category based on the most frequent category or average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its ease of use and low calculation time make it a preferred algorithm by data scientists, but as the test dataset grows, the processing time lengthens, making it less appealing for classification tasks. KNN is typically used for recommendation engines and image recognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Random forest&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Random forest is another flexible supervised machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression purposes. The &quot;forest&quot; references a collection of uncorrelated decision trees, which are then merged together to reduce variance and create more accurate data predictions.&lt;/p&gt;', 1, '2023-02-20 15:35:21'),
(11, 1, 7, 'Unsupervised learning', '1679076560_download.png', '&lt;h2&gt;What is unsupervised learning?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unsupervised learning, also known as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ibm.com/in-en/topics/machine-learning&quot;&gt;unsupervised machine learning&lt;/a&gt;, uses machine learning algorithms to analyze and cluster unlabeled datasets. These algorithms discover hidden patterns or data groupings without the need for human intervention. Its ability to discover similarities and differences in information make it the ideal solution for exploratory data analysis, cross-selling strategies, customer segmentation, and image recognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Common unsupervised learning approaches&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unsupervised learning models are utilized for three main tasks&mdash;clustering, association, and dimensionality reduction. Below we&rsquo;ll define each learning method and highlight common algorithms and approaches to conduct them effectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clustering&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clustering is&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;a data mining technique which groups unlabeled data based on their similarities or differences. Clustering algorithms are used to process raw, unclassified data objects into groups represented by structures or patterns in the information. Clustering algorithms can be categorized into a few types, specifically exclusive, overlapping, hierarchical, and probabilistic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exclusive and Overlapping Clustering&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exclusive clustering is a form of grouping that stipulates a data point can exist only in one cluster. This can also be referred to as &ldquo;hard&rdquo; clustering. The K-means clustering algorithm is an example of exclusive clustering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;K-means clustering&lt;/strong&gt; is a common example of an exclusive clustering method where data points are assigned into K groups, where K represents the number of clusters based on the distance from each group&rsquo;s centroid. The data points closest to a given centroid will be clustered under the same category. A larger K value will be indicative of smaller groupings with more granularity whereas a smaller K value will have larger groupings and less granularity. K-means clustering is commonly used in market segmentation, document clustering, image segmentation, and image compression.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overlapping clusters differs from exclusive clustering in that it allows data points to belong to multiple clusters with separate&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;degrees of membership. &ldquo;Soft&rdquo; or fuzzy k-means clustering is an example of overlapping clustering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hierarchical clustering&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hierarchical clustering, also known as hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA), is an unsupervised clustering algorithm that can be categorized in two ways; they can be agglomerative or divisive. Agglomerative clustering is considered a &ldquo;bottoms-up approach.&rdquo; Its data points are isolated as separate groupings initially, and then they are merged together iteratively on the basis of similarity until one cluster has been achieved. Four different methods are commonly used to measure similarity:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ward&rsquo;s linkage:&lt;/strong&gt; This method states that the distance between two clusters is defined by the increase in the sum of squared after the clusters are merged.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Average linkage:&lt;/strong&gt; This method is defined by the mean distance between two points in each cluster&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Complete (or maximum) linkage:&lt;/strong&gt; This method is defined by the maximum distance between two points in each cluster&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Single (or minimum) linkage: &lt;/strong&gt;This method is defined by the minimum distance between two points in each cluster&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Euclidean distance is the most common metric used to calculate these distances; however, other metrics, such as Manhattan distance, are also cited in clustering literature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Divisive clustering can be defined as the opposite of agglomerative clustering; instead it takes a &ldquo;top-down&rdquo; approach. In this case, a single data cluster is divided based on the differences between data points. Divisive clustering is not commonly used, but it is still worth noting in the context of hierarchical clustering. These clustering processes are usually visualized using a dendrogram, a tree-like diagram that documents the merging or splitting of data points at each iteration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Probabilistic clustering&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A probabilistic model is an unsupervised technique that helps us solve density estimation or &ldquo;soft&rdquo; clustering problems. In probabilistic clustering, data points are clustered based on the likelihood that they belong to a particular distribution. The Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) is the one of the most commonly used probabilistic clustering methods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaussian Mixture Models&lt;/strong&gt; are classified as mixture models, which means that they are made up of an unspecified number of probability distribution functions. GMMs are primarily leveraged to determine which Gaussian, or normal, probability distribution a given data point belongs to. If the mean or variance are known, then we can determine which distribution a given data point belongs to. However, in GMMs, these variables are not known, so we assume that a latent, or hidden, variable exists to cluster data points appropriately. While it is not required to use the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm, it is a commonly used to estimate the assignment probabilities for a given data point to a particular data cluster.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;', 1, '2023-02-20 15:36:54'),

In the absence of a training dataset, it is bound to learn from its experience.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reinforcement Learning (RL) is the science of decision making. It is about learning the optimal behavior in an environment to obtain maximum reward. In RL, the data is accumulated from machine learning systems that use a trial-and-error method.
